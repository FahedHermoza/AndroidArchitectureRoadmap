Welcome to Android Architecture Roadmap

The main goal of this roadmap is to help someone who gains knowledge of Android architecture.
This roadmap was an idea after giving a talk to the GDG Cusco community about Android Architecture 
in the real world, resources used are shared below:
- **[Talk: Android Architecture in the real world](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zhMWp0l3Xzxt324TwmSncworTvLwiuTX_Tenj51vTnk/edit?usp=sharing)**

This contains all topics to help you find what you are looking for quickly. I hope I can help you.

## üí° Inspiration
This project is inspired by [Mobile Developer Security Roadmap ](https://github.com/rviannaoliveira/mobile-developer-security-roadmap), [Android Developer Roadmap 2022](https://github.com/skydoves/android-developer-roadmap). So thank you for the authors providing the roadmap ideas. Also, you can learn a lot of knowledge from the repositories.

## üö¶ Wrap Up
If you have an idea to improve the map, feel free to discuss it in the issues.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Disclamer
This information is focused on semi-senior and senior engineers. Use your own judgement and use with caution.
