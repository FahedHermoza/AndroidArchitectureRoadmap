Welcome to Android Architecture Roadmap

The main goal of this roadmap is to help anyone who gains knowledge of Android architecture.
This roadmap was an idea after giving a talk to the GDG Cusco community about Android Architecture 
in the real world, resources used are shared below:
- **[Talk: Android Architecture in the real world](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zhMWp0l3Xzxt324TwmSncworTvLwiuTX_Tenj51vTnk/edit?usp=sharing)**

This contains all topics to help you find what you are looking for quickly. I hope I can help you.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Resources
The talk "Android Architecture
in the real world" is based on the following resources:
- **[Book: Real-World Android by Tutorials](https://www.kodeco.com/books/real-world-android-by-tutorials)**
- **[Book: Android Test-Driven Development by Tutorials](https://www.kodeco.com/books/android-test-driven-development-by-tutorials)**

## üí° Inspiration
This project is inspired by [Mobile Developer Security Roadmap ](https://github.com/rviannaoliveira/mobile-developer-security-roadmap), [Android Developer Roadmap 2022](https://github.com/skydoves/android-developer-roadmap/blob/main/README.md). So thank you for the authors providing the roadmap ideas. Also, you can learn a lot of knowledge from the repositories.

## üö¶ Wrap Up
If you have an idea to improve the map, feel free to discuss it in the issues.
